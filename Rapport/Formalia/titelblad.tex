}{% the abstract
This project focused on the development of a cost-effective impedance analyzer specifically designed for the characterization of passive components such as capacitors and inductors.

The initial phase involved a problem analysis to identify the target market, assess existing impedance analyzers in terms of functionality, cost, and accessibility. Our analysis revealed a gap in the market for a device that combines key features of high-end instruments at a price point accessible to a broader audience, including hobbyists, educational institutions, and small-scale enterprises.

Based on this, we developed an impedance analyzer with specifications aimed at delivering high performance at a reduced cost. The design phase included defining critical system requirements, followed by a lengthy hardware, and software, design phase and culminating in the creation of a PCB. The PCB was subsequently tested to validate the projects functionality against the set specifications.

The resulting impedance analyzer demonstrated capabilities for measuring impedance across a wide frequency range and is suitable for characterizing important parameters of passive components. This project offers a practical solution for affordable impedance measurement but also contributes to making advanced electronic testing equipment more accessible to the general public.
