\chapter{Sample Memory Distribution Data-rate} \label{App:MDIST_BUSY}
This appendix shows the measured busy time of the Sample Memory Distribution module. The busy time of the module is the postive width of the signal, roughly \SIQ{80}{\nano\second}. Figure \ref{fig_App_MDIST_BUSY} shows the measured busy time, here the memory is being programemd with data at a rate of \SIQ{9.091}{\mega\hertz}.
