\chapter{Pulse Generator Measurements} \label{App:PulseGenTest}
It was necessary to make a more advanced version with absolute control over the pulse width of the pulses, as the first pulse of the simpler pulse generator in section \refq{subsec:Pulse_Generator} will sometimes make short, initial, pulses as it works entirely by gating the main clock and is subject to variations in pulsewidths depending on when, exactly, the generator is started relative to the main clock, this can cause violations of the LTC2311 timing. This variation in the pulse widths can be seen on figure xyz where the output of the simple pulse generator has been measured.
