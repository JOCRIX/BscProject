\section{Commercial Instruments Capabilities} \label{sec:CommercialImpedanceAnalyzerCapabilities}
A few LCR meters and impedance analyzers were reviewed in section \ref{sec:CommercialImpedanceMeasurement}, there are many more but it would be impractical to list all of them, it was done in order to analyze what functionality they have. Their functionality and price points are, however, closely related. This section seeks to break down some of the functionality a customer could expect at certain price points. The results for this can be seen in table \ref{tab:2_3_CapabilityTab}.

    $\mathbf{^1}$ The test frequencies for the U1733C are in pre-determined steps.\\
    $\mathbf{^2}$ \textit{Z} refers to impedance measurement accuracy. \textit{$\phi$} refers specifically to the phase measurement. The term \textit{basic accuracy} covers the minimum accuracy of L, C, R, ESR, D, Q measurements across the frequency range of the instrument.\\
    $\mathbf{^3}$ \textit{simple} refers to the instruments U/I being a few buttons and an LCD display as shown on figure \ref{fig:2_2_U1733C}.\\
    $\mathbf{^4}$ The Rohde \& Schwartz LCX can do frequency sweeps if an extra software option is purchased.\\

There is a clear distinction in the level of features available at different price points. The U1733C is affordable for most individuals but lacks a lot of the functions available at higher price brackets. The LCX and 6500B will contain more advanced hardware and a major difference between these two is there test frequency ranges, but, it is noteworthy how some of their features are due to them having more advanced software and interfaces. Some of these features could be made available in a lower price bracket with software alone.
