\section{Problem Analysis Conclusion} \label{sec:probAnalConc}
The impedance of a DUT can be measured with a complicated setup using oscilloscopes and signal generators, but this setup is vulnerable to human errors and inaccuracies that are caused by, potentially, long test probe leads, probe and oscilloscope input capacitances and so on. The measurement result must then be manually converted into the quantities the user is interested in, in order to analyze the DUT.

There exists a plethora of commercial instruments to perform, and automate, a lot of the same measurements that would otherwise have to be done manually. They vary wildly in their capabilities and in their price. The price is often a show-stopper for many individuel electronic developers when they are considering acquiring a more capable instrument. There is a demand in the market for a more capable LCR meter, or impedance analyzer, with greater range and capability at a lower price point.
