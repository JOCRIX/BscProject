\chapter{Problem Analysis} \label{ch:ProblemAnalysis}
Chapter \refq{ch:Introduction} highlighted the cost of precise impedance analyzers and LCR meters, and as a result the difficulty hobbyist might have in obtaining accurate impedance measurements. This section seeks to investigate why these instruments come at such a premium.

A typical method a hobbyist might use to estimate the impedance of a device will be introduced in addition to different commercially available instruments along with their capabilities, such that some insight may reveal why these instruments are so costly.

The demand of lower priced impedance analyzers will also be researched and discussed, such that a conclusion to the initial problem statement can be drawn.
