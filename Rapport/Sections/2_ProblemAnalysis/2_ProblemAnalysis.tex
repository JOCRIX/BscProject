\chapter{Problem Analysis} \label{ch:ProblemAnalysis}
Chapter \refq{ch:Introduction} highlighted the cost of precise impedance analyzers and LCR meters, and as a result the difficulty for a hobbyists in obtaining accurate impedance measurements.

This section seeks to investigate why these instruments come at such a premium. Here a typical method a hobbyists might use to estimate the impedance of a device will be introduced in addition to different commercially available instruments together with their capabilities,
such that some insight to why these instruments are so costly may be gained. 

The demand of lower priced impedance analyzers will also be researched and discussed, such that a conclusion to the initial problem statement can be drawn.
