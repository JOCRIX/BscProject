\subsection{DAC Power Amp} \label{subsec:DAC_Filter}
The system is to test impedance over a broad range of \SIQ{100}{\milli\ohm} to \SIQ{100}{\mega\ohm}, according to requirement ยง3 from section \ref{ch:SystemRequirements}. In order to excite impedances, especially in the range of \SIQ{10}{\ohm} and lower, a power amplifier is required. This amplifier must be capable of driving both reactive and passive devices. This is achieved by the use of controlled output impedance and the utilized range resistors used to measure the DUT current. 

The amplifier is designed as a class AB amplifier output stage and a high speed op-amp. The circuit used can be seen in figure \ref{fig_7_1_1_5_DAC_POWER_AMP}.

About \SIQ{15}{\milli\ampere} of bias current for the output stage has been chosen. From BC547B and BC557 datasheets, \cite{BC547_datasheet} \cite{BC557_datasheet}, the base-emitter voltage can be found to be roughly \SIQ{730}{\milli\volt} at a collector current of \SIQ{15}{\milli\ampere}. This bias-current is set by the use of a simply diode. This adds some thermal stability, given they are thermally closely linked, as the temperature coefficient of a diode is negative, whilst positive for a transistor. The required DC current for a 1n4148 diode to have a voltage-drop of \SIQ{730}{\milli\volt} is estimated to \SIQ{12}{\mA}. The supply voltage is from a split supply of $\pm$ \SIQ{5}{\volt}, resulting in a total supply voltage of \SIQ{10}{\volt}. Assuming that the two biasing diodes, D12 and D16 in figure \ref{fig_7_1_1_5_DAC_POWER_AMP}, are matched the voltage across the biasing resistors R6 and R13 will be $10-2\cdot0.73 = $\SIQ{8.54}{\volt}. Combined series resistance of R6 and R13 can be estimated as $\frac{8.54 V}{0.012 A} = $ \SIQ{712}{\ohm}. Resistors of \SIQ{330}{\ohm} has been chosen, producing a biasing current of \SIQ{12.9}{\milli\ampere}.

To increase the input impedance and reduce output distortion of the amplifier, an op-amp is used with the output class AB stage in its feedback loop. The used op-amp is a \SIQ{80}{\mega\hertz} GBW op-amp \cite{AD8032_datasheet}.
