\subsection{PCB Design} \label{subsec:PCBDesign}

The designed analog front end has been implemented via a designed PCB. This PCB can be seen in figure \refq{fig_PCB}. One key element to take note of here is the seperation of digital and analog ground. The only place the digital and analog ground meet is directly under the two ADCs and the DAC. This ensures a start-ground scheme. 5 opto-coupler ICs have been used to interface varies components on the analog section, this ensures that no noisy digital signals will be routed through the sensitive analog section.
