\subsection{DC Supplies} \label{subsec:DCSupples}

Several DC supplies are required to power the impedance analyzer, so an overview has been made to visualize this in table \refq{tab:7_1_6_Supply_Voltages}.

\caption{Overview of Supply Voltages in the System}
\label{tab:7_1_6_Supply_Voltages}
\end{table}

An estimate of the expected load is required in order to make the supply rails from table \refq{tab:7_1_6_Supply_Voltages} and this estimate has been made and can be seen in appendix \refq{App:PowerConsumption}. A Mean Well RT65C\cite{RT65C} power supply will be used to power the impedance analyzer, it will supply a $\pm 15V$ rail a long with a $+5V$ rail. The $+5V$ rail will be used to power the digital circuits directly, while the $\pm 15V$ will be used to power the analog front end. The analog supplies will be kept separate from the digital supplies to reduce noise in the analog circuits. The diagram for the supply can be seen on figure xyz
