\section{Analog Front End Module} \label{sec:AnalogFrontEndModule}
The Analog Front End module consists of all the analog hardware that has to do with generating test signals and sampling the resulting DUT voltage and currents. The architecture of this module can seen on figure \refq{fig_6_1_AnalogFrontEnd} in section \refq{sec:AnalogFrontEnd} and this section will document the design of the module.
