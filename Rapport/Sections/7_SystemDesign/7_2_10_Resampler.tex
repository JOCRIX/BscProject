\subsection{ADC resampler} \label{subsec:ADCResampler}
The ADC resampler block is generating the 'acquire start' (trigger) inputs for the ADC control block. When 'acquire start' for the ADC control module is asserted, the ADC control will start a single conversion. The ADC resampler will generate $N$ amount of trigger pulses for the ADC control block, with $M$ frequency.

The amount of pulses generated, i.e. the sample size $N$, and the sample frequency $M$ along with a 'start' signal is set by a number registers in the internal memory that was described in section \refq{subsec:Memory}. The signals going into, or out of, the ADC resampler can be seen on figure cyz
