\section{Binning} \label{sec:5_1_Binning}
Binning is a principle often used when sorting components. It allows a target value and tolerance to be programmed in to the device. For example, if on wishes to sort 100 nF capacitors in to different bins of accuracy, the target value is set to 100 nF, bins might be \SIQ{1}{\%} and \SIQ{5}{\%}. Whenever a component is measured, the instrument will indicate what bin the component belongs to, if it is within the less than \SIQ{1}{\%} error bin, this will be indicated, if it is within \SIQ{5}{\&} error bin this will be indicated and so on.
