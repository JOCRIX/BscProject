\section{Histogram} \label{sec:5_2_Histogram}
The histogram function is intended to give the user insight in the distribution of a components population. It should be possible to set the instrument in histrogram mode, where the user will then measure a large number of the same type of components. The instrument must then be capable of displaying a histogram of the components distribution as well as the components mean and standard deviation at a given user defined level of significance.
