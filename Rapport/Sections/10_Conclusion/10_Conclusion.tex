This project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of developing a cost-effective impedance analyzer for hobbyists and small businesses. While the hardware achieved its core objectives and laid a solid foundation, limitations in software and accuracy verification highlighted areas for improvement. These gaps, primarily due to time constraints, do not diminish the project's overall significance but instead point to clear opportunities for future development. By addressing calibration functionality and enhancing software features, the analyzer could achieve its full potential as a reliable, accurate, capable and user-friendly tool. Ultimately, this project serves as a promising step toward increasing access to advanced electronic testing equipment for hobbyists and small businesses.
