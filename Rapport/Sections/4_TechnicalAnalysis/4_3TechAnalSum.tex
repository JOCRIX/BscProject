\section{Summary} \label{sec:TechAnalSum}
The technical analysis has introduced varies topologies used in the industry as well as what impedance is, and different ways it can
be described. The reasoning for the somewhat extensive derived quantities section is that many manufacturers of electrical components
states different quantities, some mention D or dissipation factor, some Q, some loss tangent, and some none at all. Thus it is
imperative that these different quantities are introduced, as they are essential in what the solution must undertake.

This chapter introduces these varies elements such that a conclusion upon what methods can be used to answer the problem statement can
be drawn.
