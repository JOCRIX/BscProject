\section{Impedance analysis} \label{sec:ImpedanceAnalysis}
In order to measure, and analyze, an impedance it is important to have a clear definition of what impedance actually is. This sections will describe what an impedance is and how it can be used to analyze a device under test (DUT).

The impedance of a DUT, or circuit, is the devices ability to restrict the flow of alternating current and is the relationship between the
