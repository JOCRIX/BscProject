\subsection{I-V Method} \label{ssec:IVMethod}
The I-V method or current voltage method, has already been shortly introduced in section \ref{sec:MeasureReactiveComponents}, here it was realized by the use of a function generator and an oscilloscope. In this chapter, the I-V method will however be introduced in a more broad spectrum, that is to say, the general principle of the mothod will be outlined.
