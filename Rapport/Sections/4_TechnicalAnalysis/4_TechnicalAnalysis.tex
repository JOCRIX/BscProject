\chapter{Technical Analysis} \label{ch:TechnicalAnalysis}
This chapter will discuss what an \textit{impedance} is. The chapter will explain certain techniques for measuring the signals required to calculate the impedance and, once the impedance has been quantified, how to convert the impedance into the quantities of interest.
