\chapter{Technical Analysis} \label{ch:TechnicalAnalysis}
From chapter \ref{ch:ProblemAnalysis} it follows that impedance measurement is the focal point of this project. This chapter will discuss what an \textit{impedance} is, as it is essential to understand in order to quantize it. Different techniques used in the industry for measuring impedance will be introduced here, as well as how different quantaties of interest can be derived from the measured DUT impedance. 

Analysis of the different methods typically utilized to measure impedance is essential in understanding the technical difficulties that drive the complexity and cost of commercial impedance analyzers.
