\chapter{Problem Statement} \label{ch:ProblemStatement}
There is a hole in the market for LCR meters and impedance analyzers. The current commercial offerings with more advanced features are too expensive for the individual to even consider. Brands like Rigol and Siglent have made instruments like oscilloscopes and signal generators something most people can afford, but the same revolution has not yet happened for impedance analyzers. This project will seek to bridge the apparent market gap between cost and functionality. This conlusion eventually leads to the following problem statement,
that this report will try to anwser:

\textbf{\textit{How can an impedance analyzer be constructed when it must have a similar bandwidth, resolution, accuracy, I/O and ability to display data in a way that is typically only found on high-end instruments, but at a price point where an individual could purchase one for a home laboratory?}}
