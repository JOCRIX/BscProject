\section{System Verification Conclusion} \label{subsec:8_3_SystemVerifyConclude}
The project does not manage to pass all of the requirements set for this project. Many of the requirements are software functions that could be developed with time, they are not technically challenging to develop, just time consuming. It is not possible to verify the accuracy due to the lack of available reference capacitors, inductors, resistors and other test equipment. 

The core of the project is the sampling system, and the sampling system works well. The test parameters can be set by the user in software and the system will carry out the sampling of the DUTs voltage and current signals and display the test results to the user. The core of the project is in a good place, all the hardware works, but some of the software needs more development time.
