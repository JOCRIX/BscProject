Consider the dataset PimaIndiansDiabetes2 [in mlbench package, which you probably need to install] for predicting the probability of being diabetes positive based on multiple clinical variables.



```{r}
# Load the data and remove NAs
data("PimaIndiansDiabetes2", package = "mlbench")
PimaIndiansDiabetes2 <- na.omit(PimaIndiansDiabetes2)
# Inspect the data
head(PimaIndiansDiabetes2, 3)
```

Do an analysis similar to the analysis of breast cancer data in the lecture.
