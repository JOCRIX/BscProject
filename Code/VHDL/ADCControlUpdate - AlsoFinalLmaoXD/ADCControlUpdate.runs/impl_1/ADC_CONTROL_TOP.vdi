INFO: [Timing 38-35] Done setting XDC timing constraints.
WARNING: [Place 30-568] A LUT 'pulse_gen_1_SDACLK/EXT_EXT_SCK_POS_ADC_CONTROL_TO_ADC_A_OUT_OBUF_inst_i_1' is driving clock pin of 22 registers. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved registers are:
	adc_ctrl1/serial_data_adc_1_reg[13] {FDRE}
	adc_ctrl1/serial_data_adc_1_reg[14] {FDRE}
	adc_ctrl1/serial_data_adc_1_reg[2] {FDRE}
	adc_ctrl1/serial_data_adc_1_reg[7] {FDRE}
	adc_ctrl1/serial_data_adc_1_reg[15] {FDRE}
WARNING: [Place 30-574] Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	EXT_TEST_ACQUIRE_START_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to IOB_X0Y111
	EXT_TEST_ACQUIRE_START_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y1
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.

WARNING: [DRC CFGBVS-1] Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties: Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net pulse_gen_1_SDACLK/EXT_EXT_SCK_POS_ADC_CONTROL_TO_ADC_B_OUT_OBUF is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pulse_gen_1_SDACLK/EXT_EXT_SCK_POS_ADC_CONTROL_TO_ADC_A_OUT_OBUF_inst_i_1/O, cell pulse_gen_1_SDACLK/EXT_EXT_SCK_POS_ADC_CONTROL_TO_ADC_A_OUT_OBUF_inst_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT pulse_gen_1_SDACLK/EXT_EXT_SCK_POS_ADC_CONTROL_TO_ADC_A_OUT_OBUF_inst_i_1 is driving clock pin of 22 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
adc_ctrl1/serial_clk_count_reg[0], adc_ctrl1/serial_clk_count_reg[1], adc_ctrl1/serial_clk_count_reg[2], adc_ctrl1/serial_clk_count_reg[3], adc_ctrl1/serial_clk_count_reg[4], adc_ctrl1/serial_clk_count_reg[5], adc_ctrl1/serial_data_adc_1_reg[0], adc_ctrl1/serial_data_adc_1_reg[10], adc_ctrl1/serial_data_adc_1_reg[11], adc_ctrl1/serial_data_adc_1_reg[12], adc_ctrl1/serial_data_adc_1_reg[13], adc_ctrl1/serial_data_adc_1_reg[14], adc_ctrl1/serial_data_adc_1_reg[15], adc_ctrl1/serial_data_adc_1_reg[1], adc_ctrl1/serial_data_adc_1_reg[2]... and (the first 15 of 22 listed)
