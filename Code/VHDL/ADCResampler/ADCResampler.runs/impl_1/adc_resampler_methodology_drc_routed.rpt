The clock pin r_arm_500_ns_delay_reg_P/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin r_dds_clk_count_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin r_dds_clk_count_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin r_dds_clk_count_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin r_dds_clk_count_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#9 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin r_dds_clk_count_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#10 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin r_dds_clk_count_reg[5]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#11 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin r_dds_mux_enable_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#12 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin r_sampler_armed_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell r_arm_500_ns_delay_reg_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) r_arm_500_ns_delay_reg_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch r_arm_500_ns_delay_reg_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin r_arm_500_ns_delay_reg_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 1 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
