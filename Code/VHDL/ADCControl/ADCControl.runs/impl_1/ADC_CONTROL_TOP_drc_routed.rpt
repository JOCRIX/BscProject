CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pulse_gen_1_SDACLK/EXT_EXT_SCK_POS_ADC_CONTROL_TO_ADC_B_OUT_OBUF is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pulse_gen_1_SDACLK/Pulse_out/O, cell pulse_gen_1_SDACLK/Pulse_out. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pulse_gen_3_45ns/i_PULSE_DCNVSCKL_PULSE_PULSEGEN_3_ACTIVE_PULSE_WIDTH_OUT_TO_ADC_CONTROL_IN is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pulse_gen_3_45ns/start_adc_control_i_1/O, cell pulse_gen_3_45ns/start_adc_control_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT pulse_gen_1_SDACLK/Pulse_out is driving clock pin of 16 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
adc_ctrl1/clks_done_reg, adc_ctrl1/clks_done_reg__0,
adc_ctrl1/reset_acquisition_reg, adc_ctrl1/reset_acquisition_reg__0,
adc_ctrl1/serial_clk_count_reg[0], adc_ctrl1/serial_clk_count_reg[0]__0,
adc_ctrl1/serial_clk_count_reg[1], adc_ctrl1/serial_clk_count_reg[1]__0,
adc_ctrl1/serial_clk_count_reg[2], adc_ctrl1/serial_clk_count_reg[2]__0,
adc_ctrl1/serial_clk_count_reg[3], adc_ctrl1/serial_clk_count_reg[3]__0,
adc_ctrl1/serial_clk_count_reg[4], adc_ctrl1/serial_clk_count_reg[4]__0,
adc_ctrl1/stop_adc_control_reg (the first 15 of 16 listed)
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT pulse_gen_3_45ns/start_adc_control_i_1 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
adc_ctrl1/start_adc_control_reg
Related violations: <none>
